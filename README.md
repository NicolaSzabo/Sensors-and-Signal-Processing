# Sensors-and-Signal-Processing

Repository for the Sensors and Signal Processing course at FHNW as part of the Master's program in Biomedical Engineering, 2nd Semester.

This repository includes a notebook used for processing magnetometer signals obtained from a device placed inside a Helmholtz coil and later within a spiral coil on a coordinate grid. A tracking algorithm was employed to calculate the smartphone's position based on the magnetometer data. Additionally, the repository contains a scientific paper detailing the experiments conducted and the results achieved.
